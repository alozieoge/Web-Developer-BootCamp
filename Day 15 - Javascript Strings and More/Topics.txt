Strings
-------
- String of characters that represent text.
- Wrapped in either single-quotes ('...') or double-quotes ("...").
- JS strings support quotes within strings
  >> "I told her 'go away!'"
  >> 'She said "No!"'
  
String Indices & Length
-----------------------
- Strings are zero-indexed (like JS arrays).
- Strings have a length property by default.
  >> "Dumbo Octopus".length
  
- Strings can be concatenated using the + operator.
- Strings are immutable. 
- Adding a number to a string results in a string, because JS casts the number to a string before performing the + operation.
- To get the type of a variable or value, use typeof:
  >> typeof "Banana"  or
  >> typeof("Banana")
  
String Methods
--------------
- Built-in actions that can be performed on a string.
  - See all JS string methods on MDN > References > Javascript > Strings.

- Multiple methods can be chained together and applied on a string.
  >> let greeting = "    hello again!!!    "
  >> greeting.trim().toUpperCase()
  >>>> "HELLO AGAIN!!!"
