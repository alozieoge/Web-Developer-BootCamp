Strings
-------
- String of characters that represent text.
- Wrapped in either single-quotes ('...') or double-quotes ("...").
- JS strings support quotes within strings
  >> "I told her 'go away!'"
  >> 'She said "No!"'
  

String Indices & Length
-----------------------
- Strings are zero-indexed (like JS arrays).
- Strings have a length property by default.
  >> "Dumbo Octopus".length
  
- Strings can be concatenated using the + operator.
- Strings are immutable. 
- Adding a number to a string results in a string, because JS casts the number to a string before performing the + operation.
- To get the type of a variable or value, use typeof:
  >> typeof "Banana"  or
  >> typeof("Banana")
  
String Methods
--------------
- Built-in actions that can be performed on a string.
  - See all JS string methods on MDN > References > Javascript > Strings.

- Multiple methods can be chained together and applied on a string.
  >> let greeting = "    hello again!!!    "
  >> greeting.trim().toUpperCase()
  >>>> "HELLO AGAIN!!!"
  

String Methods with Arguments
-----------------------------
- Arguments are inputs that can be passed into a method to modify how it behaves. 
  >> let tvShow = "catdog";
  >> tvShow.indexOf("cat"); // 0
  >> tvShow.indexOf("dog"); // 3
  >> tvShow.indexOf("z");   // -1 (not found)
  
- Optional method arguments are usually enclosed in square brackets [...] or are preceeded with a question mark ?
  .slice(beginIndex [, endIndex]) or
  .slice(beginIndex, ?endIndex)
   - returns a subset of the string starting from the beginIndex to the (endIndex - 1) or the last character.
  
  .replace(searchString, replaceString)
   - replaces the first occurrence of the searchString with the replaceString.
  
  .replaceAll(searchString, replaceString)
   - replaces all occurrence of the searchString with the replaceString.
   
  .repeat(count)
   - repeats the string count number of times in a new string.
   

String Template Literals
------------------------
- Template literals are strings that allow embedded expressions, which will be evaluated and then cast into a resulting string.
- Requires the use of: 
  - back-tick character to enclose the string, not single or double-quotes.
  - ${...} to contain each embedded expression.
  
  >> `I counted ${3 + 4} sheep` // "I counted 7 sheep"
  >> `You bought ${qty} ${product.toUpperCase()}. Total is: $${price * qty}` // 'You bought 5 ARTICHOKE. Total is: $11.25'
