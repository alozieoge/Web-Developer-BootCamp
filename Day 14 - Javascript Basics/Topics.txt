Javascript Basics
=================

Objectives
----------
- Why Javascript
- Javascript numbers
- Varriables & Let
- Const vs Var
- Booleans
- Variable naming & conventions


Why Javascipt?
--------------
- Javascript makes it possible to implement functionality on a website.
  - Chat
  - Games
  - Animation
  - Shopping
  - UX
  - Interactive effects
  - Live updates


Primitive Types
---------------
- Types of information that JS can work with / basic building blocks.
  - Number
  - String
  - Boolean
  - Null
  - Undefined
  
- Other less common types are:
  - Symbol
  - BigInt

- The console is a REPL.
  R - Read
  E - Execute
  P - Print
  L - Loop


Numbers
-------
- JS has only 1 number type.
- Positive, negative, whole, decimal numbers are all number type.
- Operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulo / Remainder, Exponent

- NaN is a value that is of type: number but represents something that is not a number.
- Priority of amathematical operations:
  P - Parentheses
  E - Exponent
  M - Multiplication
  D - Division
  A - Addition
  S - Subtraction


Variables
---------
- Variables are labels for storing and accessing values. 
- Can be defined using `let`. 

- `const` works like `let` but the value cannot be changed / updated.
- `var` was previously used to define variables in JS. But succeeded by `let`.


Booleans
--------
- true or false

- JS variables can change type.
- Typescript is a version of / add-on to Javascript with strong-typed vriables.


Variable Naming and Conventions
-------------------------------
- No spaces inside variable names / identifiers.
- No number as first character in variable names.
- Variables names can start with underscore _. 

- Use camelCase to name variables.
- Use meaningful variable names instead of just 1 letter.
- Start Boolean variable names with is***.
- Err on the side of meaningfulness instead of conciseness.
