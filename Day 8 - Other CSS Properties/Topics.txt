Alpha and Opacity
-----------------
- Alpha is the level of transparency applied to an element's background color. 
- 0 (full transparency) <= alpha <= 1 (no transparency)

- Represented in rgba: (0, 209, 112, 0.5)
- or in hex system: #00cca80f
                           ^^ alpha value


- Opacity sets the level of transparency of an element and all elements contained within it. 
- It applied to both the (text) color and background color of an element and its child elements.
- 0 (full transparency) <= opacity <= 1 (no transparency)
- It is a stand-alone CSS property. { opacity: 0.5; }


Position
--------
- Sets the position of an element in a document. 
- Determines how 4 other properties work: 
  { top, right, bottom, left }. 
  
Position values
---------------
1. static
- Element is positioned in the normal document flow.
- Default setting of all elements. 
- { top, right, bottom, left } have no effect. 

2. relative
- Element is positioned in the normal document flow, 
- But offset relative to itself (static position) based on { top, right, bottom, left } values. 

3. absolute 
- Element is removed from the normal document flow. 
- By default, it is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor if any, 
- Otherwise it is positioned relative to the initial container / ancestor i.e. <body></body>. 
- Based on the { top, right, bottom, left } values. 

4. fixed
- Element is removed from the normal document flow,  
- And occupies no space in the page layout. 
- It is positioned relative to the initial containing block, defined by the page's current viewport.
- Commonly used to make the navigation bar remain at the top of the screen while scrolling up or down a webpage. 

5. sticky
- Element is positioned in the normal document flow, 
- And offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor (nearest ancestor with scrolling mechanism enabled) and containing block. 
- Might be tricky to get it to work correctly.
