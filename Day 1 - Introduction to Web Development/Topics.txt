Day 1: Introduction to Web Development


The Internet
------------
- The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate through TCP/IP protocol. 
- The World Wide Web (WWW) is an information infrastructure / system that allows us to share documents and other resources over the internet. 
- These documents / resources are identified by URLS (Uniform Resource Locators).
- Documents are transferred via HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).


Front-end / Back-end
--------------------
- Front-end web development focuses on the client-side of the web / browser.
- The client is a computer / machine / device that makes the HTTP request to the server. 

- Back-end web development focuses on the server-side of the web.
- The server is a machine / computer / software that satisfies requests received from the client. 
- The server sends back the instructions / code (HTML, CSS, Javascript) required to construct the web page, to the client.


HTML, CSS, Javascript
---------------------
- The browser on the client-side unpacks the instructions and renders the webpage to the user.
- HTML, CSS and Javascript are the technologies that enable the browser to render / display a webpage based on the response received from the server.
